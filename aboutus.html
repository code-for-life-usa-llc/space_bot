<p>Our goal is to teach people more about space and how humanity has not explored many parts of space also we want to teach people that if you keep trying anything is possible like when we went to the moon for the first time people did not think it would be possible but it was they just kept going and keep trying until it finally worked. That is our goal and we hope this inspired you to be just more than normal but to change the world and help people out there</p>
